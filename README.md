* See the comments at hte top of the .heavyvimrc and .lightvimrc to understand how to use these

* The .lightvimrc has no plugins. The .heavyvimrc uses plugins. The plugins probaly only work on certain debian distros.

* install simply by running the script corresponding to the version of the vimrc that you want

* theoreticaly this work on other linuxes besides ubuntu but this has not been tested

* see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF9EcpYb1KE for details using vundle and vim

## OPTIONAL: install i3

          sudo apt-get install i3

* there are better ways to install and configure i3, but this works on ubuntu

* logout, select i3 as the desktop, and log back in. for a tutorial on using i3, see:
